_A Language with Timeless Referencial Transparancy_

Candid is a general purpose programming language, with a completely refactored
programming environment. The type inference is in the editor, which accesses
the version control system directly, which tracks functions rather than text
files. Two programmers may edit the same code using their preferred names,
syntax, indentation style, and language features. Multiple versions of the same
library may be used by a program, not due to any special effort, it merely
comes free with the other design choices. Old versions of the language can
compile, edit, run, and typecheck code created by newer versions (at least,
that's the plan!).

Candid is currently still highly experimental software, with a handful of
incomplete implementations. Extensive work is still needed on the type theory
and proof system. The user interfaces are missing large pieces. Version control
is a minimal hack that could hardly be called version control.

The core concepts, however, are sound and developing nicely.

For the time being, this website is mostly a place to organize thoughts and
type theoretic mumblings. Eventually there'll be an online editor hosted
here...
